<p>This is the beginning of my long and wonderful journey into JavaScript programming and mapping.</p>
<h2>Reactions to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h2>
<p>As for the Floating Sheep Manifesto, I would have to say that the paper presented lines of thought that had never occurred to me. In my simple way of looking at map making, I would be a cartographer. To me, maps are a tool of presentation, that should look good, and be visual appealing. An important non verbal way of proving your point or argument, your geographic proof. The presentation has to convey the information in a way draws people in, and adds weight to your argument. Will an ugly map due, no, if it does not add power to your story do not use it.</p>
<p>That leads into the question do maps lie. I guess one could design a map based on corrupted data, but I feel more, that maps can distort, the perception of the data. Think of a map as a two dimensional spin man. In the sense that, what is the nature of a thematic map, to show the distribution of geographic phenomenon spatially, but the how is up to maker. An example, you are documenting the geographic variability of eye color in tree frogs. You favor the frogs with blue eyes over red eyes, so you choose to highlight the areas with blue eyed frogs. Thus making it seem in your map, that those frogs are more important.</p>
<p>As I move forward into what I hope is a map making career, I do plan to be one of the cartographers who make pretty and compelling maps. I also plan to keep in mind that my own personnel views can color how I present data in those pretty maps.</p>
